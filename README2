This Energy API is designed to manage and provide information about renewable electricity production percentages for various countries and years. 
It utilises SpringBoot annotation and RESTful principles as well as including functionalities for reading and writing data to a JSON file. The data is organised in a 
nested structure with years as keys and country-specific renewable electricity production percentages as values.

The Energy API focuses on CRUD implementation to interact with the data source and produce a variety of outputs based on user needs. It also contains a wide range of exception handling in order to manage any potential errors during the data retrieval processes.
